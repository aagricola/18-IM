# 18-IM
Interaction + Media

## COURSE DESCRIPTION
This fast-paced course will introduce techniques, strategies, historical context, current practices, and critical dialogs pertaining to Interaction + Media at various scales. Beginning with media non-specific interaction, the course will progress through physical computing (littlebits, micro-controllers, sensors), screen based interactive coding (Processing), web based interactive coding (p5.js), and other tools for creating interactive and responsive work. Weekly lectures and discussion will establish context for in-class studies. Students will engage in self-directed research and will produce a final studio project accompanied by a presentation and class discussion.

## Important Things to Remember
 - Help is always a click away; via the internet, your peers, or emailing me. Remember to do homework ahead of time so that you can get questions to me 48 hours before class.
 - Mistakes are great ways to learn. Be courageous, fail flamboyantly, and know that you tried your best. Don't let fear or mistakes stand in your way of learning and creating.
 - Participation and collaboration are integral parts of this class's culture. This also means you come prepared to all of the classes, do the homework, and be engaged.
 -  Share what you learn along the way and collaborate with your peers. We are embodying an open source education model.
 - You get one unexcused absence, the next diminishes your grade and the third gets an F. Please provide me with a doctors note if you are sick. Talk to me if you have an extended leave of absence.

 ## Arduino
 an Arduino (and its various clones) is a cheap, open-source, single-board, microcontroller
 We will use it mid semester, so you might want to go ahead and invest in this budget [kit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/193)

## Workshops with Paul Mirel

**Spring 2018 Workshops with MICA Visiting Engineer Paul Mirel**
Sponsored by MICA's Office of Graduate Studies

Who can come?
MICA Faculty, Staff, Graduate, Undergraduate, Open Studies Students

You can attend any of these hands-on workshops. You can attend as many as you like or just one. There are no prerequisites. The workshops are not sequential. There is no charge for the workshops.

Where are the workshops?
In the dFab Classroom, S120, in the MICA Station Building, 1400 Cathedral St.

When are the workshops?
Sundays, 3pm to 5pm. See dates below in the workshop list.

What should I bring with me?  
A laptop computer is helpful to have with you.

**January 28** -- Mimic nature with an electronic control system.
Why is it so hard to swat a fly? How does the fly know that you are trying to swat it? Flies react to changing light levels. When it starts to get darker fast, as it might when a hand or a bird approaches, the fly's nervous system identifies that as dangerous, and moves the fly away from the danger. We will build and program a circuit to react to changing light levels as a fly does.
Come learn about how to conceive of and build and program an electronic control system.


**February 4** -- Control Systems Follow-up.
Have an idea for a control system? Want to try the Fly Mimic control system again?
Come to consult with Paul on matters pertaining to electronic control systems. Come practice with the Fly Mimic system.


**February 11** -- Building Electronics: Best Practices
Do you want to use electronics in your artwork? Do you want to make them easy to debug, for when they inevitably stop working? Do you want those electronics to work during Crit? During exhibition?
Learn how to plan, organize, assemble, and package electronics systems to make them both reliable and easy to service. We will build a system, discuss components, wiring, connectors, and power, and how to make your systems modular for ease of testing.


**February 18** -- Using Transistors to Drive Powerful Electronic Components
Do you want your art to move? Do you want to control bright lights? Water pumps? Fans?
Learn how to build transistor circuits to control motors and lights.
Transistors are the fundamental unit of modern electronics. Learn how to use them.

**February 25** -- Transistors Follow-up
What powerful electronic thing do you want to control? How did that transistor circuit go together?
Come to consult with Paul about transistors and how to use them. Come practice with the components.
