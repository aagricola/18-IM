# Hello!

## Today:
- Basic Object Oriented Review
- What is Arduino?
- [Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- Tour the Environment
- Arduino vs. Processing
- Simple circuit with breadboard
- Arduino sketches
- What is Serial Communication?
- Serial send and receive data from Arduino to Processing

## What are Objects!?!?

- Objects are a way to group variables with related functions.
- They break up your ideas into building blocks -- mimicking the natural world (organs, tissues, cells)
- They make it easier to write smaller pieces to make up a more complicated structure

In the context of objects, a variable is called a **property** (or instance variable)
A function is called a **method**. The idea is to group related data (properties) with related methods that act on that data.

### Common Analogies:
- A cookie cutter is the object constructor
  the cookie is the object instance
- The blueprint for a house is the object constructor
  the house is an object instance
- The object constructor is the template
  the object is the thing itself

**Objects are collections of values and functions**

What goes in the constructor is up to you - depends on what you're making
First think about what properties and methods your object will have.
- Keep in mind that one reason to make an object is to group together
related data elements. For your methods, select clear names to help yourself stay organized.
Remember, the methods are used to change the values of the properties and to perform actions based on the propertiesâ€™ values.

## Creative Process Journal

This is where you will keep track of your progress towards a final project, from ideation and research, to prototypes, failures, and successes. In my experience, it works best as a blog (separate from your portfolio site).
The final project will be lead by your own personal interests and desires, utilizing new acquired skills and adding to them by self directed research.


## Homework

- Finish your Assignments
  - pushbutton controlling something on screen
  - something on screen control LED
- Bring your arduino kit with you the week after Spring Break
- Submit a link to your CPJ on canvas. Keep researching and exploring inspiration for your final project (ref. to last week's post if this statement confuses you)
