"Fomo stand for fear of missing out. It is a compulsive concern that one might miss something like an opportunity or satisfying event, often aroused by our close relationship with social media websites. Imagine yourself alone in the wild city, going through a well deserved digital detox but yet hungry for new social interactions. Is there any way to find your path to the next event planned in your calendar?"

## Creative Process Journal

This is meant to help you keep track of your progression. Start doing researching towards your final project. The final project will be largely lead by your own personal interests and desires, utilizing new acquired skills. Let that guide you. This will also help when you present your final project.


## Homework

- Finish your Assignments
  - pushbutton controlling something on screen
  - something on screen control LED
- Bring your arduino kit with you next week
- Submit a link to your CPJ on canvas. Keep researching and exploring inspiration for your final project (ref. to last week's post if this statement confuses you)
