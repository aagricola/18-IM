## Body in Space
[Myron Krueger - "Videoplace", Responsive Environment, 1972-1990s] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmmxVA5xhuo)

[David Rokeby - "Very Nervous System", Interactive Environment 1986](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsR7EQgG7N0)

"The installation is a complex but quick feedback loop. The feedback is not simply 'negative' or 'positive', inhibitory or reinforcing; the loop is subject to constant transformation as the elements, human and computer, change in response to each other. The two interpenetrate, until the notion of control is lost and the relationship becomes encounter and involvement.
The installation could be described as a sort of instrument that you play with your body but that implies a level of control which I am not particularly interested in. I am interested in creating a complex and resonant relationship between the interactor and the system." - David Rokeby

[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, "Surface Tension", 1992](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXLoLPkzdto)

''"Surface Tension" is an interactive installation where an image of a giant human eye follows the observer with orwellian precision.This work was inspired by a reading of Georges Bataille's text The Solar Anus during the first Gulf War: first wide-spread deployment of camera-guided "intelligent bombs". Present-day computerised surveillance techniques employed by the Department of Homeland Security in the United States through the Patriot Act, provide a new and distressing backdrop for this piece." - Rafael Lozano-Hemmer

## Remember -->

Any computer program (Processing, Arduino, ect.) consists of

**variables** (data) and **functions** (procedures) that act on that data.

**Functions** perform some kind of procedures on/with the **data** and can **return** a value as a result of this procedure that can be used in other **functions**.

## Project 1: Expanded Self
For homework this week, read the short essays from Madeline Schwartzman's latest exhibition catalogue "See Yourself X". Think about the ideas she presents of extensions of the self. Consider how the computer is utilized as a tool to map and analyze the human body, face, activity, ect. Since this assignment spans across two weeks, you can spend time developing an idea and conceptualizing what you want to make this week. Keep in mind that next week we will learn face tracking. Utilize any of the skills we have learned so far in class and make a project that extends the digital body beyond the possibilities of the physical body.

## homework

- Read essays from "See Yourself X"
- Start working on your project

## Resources

In case we don't get to it, here is a video by Daniel Shiffman on Motion Tracking, where the motion tracking example in our folder actually comes from.
