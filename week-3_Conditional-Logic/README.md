## Conditional statements

We talked a little bit about conditional statements last week.
Conditionals allow the draw loop to execute differently depending on something that is happening in the code. So the code can take different paths depending on whether certain conditions have been met and return true or false.

Else if statements execute something totally different if the if statement returns false.

We also talked about operators some last week, and the code examples this week will increasingly use operators : && (and) , || (or) , == (equal to), != (not equal to)

We will look at (mousePressed) to check if the user is holding down the mouse. This is different from using events (functions) like function mousePressed() or function keyPressed() which changes a state permanently.

We will use a boolean to create a toggle switch

And a few other things you will find in today's examples:
  - keyboard events
  - pfont
  - export
  - import svg

## History of Non-linear Narrative

  “Access to computers and the Internet completely changed the way that I consumed information and organized ideas in my head. I saw information stacked on top of itself in simultaneity, no longer confined to spatiotemporal dimensions of the book.”  – Krystal South , quote from idyrslf.com

  ![zork](http://gallery.guetech.org/zork1/zork1.jpg)

  Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with roots drawn from the original genre game, Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of Zork was written between 1977 and 1979. The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.

  olia lialina,_ my boyfriend came back from the war_ (m.b.c.b.f.t.w.)

  It tells the story of two lovers who reunite after an unspecified conflict. Fragments of dialogue convey the difficulty they have reconnecting, though not explicitly stated. She approaches the web as a medium similar to film. She calls it a netfilm. The flow splits and digresses into multiple threads, similar to a cinematic montage in which separate simultaneous actions are edited to produce the effect of simultaneity.

  Based in Seoul, South Korea,Young-hae Chang Heavy Industries, composed of the Korean Young-hae Chang and the American Marc Voge, combine text with jazz music with Flash productions in which they use solely the Monaco font. In these works they are breaking the Internet tendency to emphasize interactivity and foregrounding photo’s, illustrations and excessive use of colors.

  Shu Lea Cheang, "Brandon", bigdoll interface,
   collaboration with Jordy Jones and Cherise Fong, 1998

   Teena Brandon, 21 year old woman who was raped an killed for passing as a man  (movie “Boys Don't Cry” was based on this)
  Guggenheim Museum commissioned Taiwanese-American artist to explore Teena’s story in a non-linear, experimental way.

   ## Assignment: Non-linear Narrative
   Using the skills we have learned in class so far, create a Non-linear story. Try using various actions (mousePressed, different keys, as well as on screen buttons) to trigger different events (images, text, sounds, color changes, ect.)

   - The narrative can be linear or non-linear.
   - The content can be specific or atmospheric.
   - Any combination of input (keyboard/mouse) and output (images/text) is acceptable.


   ## Out of classwork/ Homework

   - Please submit screen shots or short mov of your drawing generator from last week to canvas.
   - Go through the code examples and be sure to read comments
   - If you are confused about conditional logic, watch these Daniel Shiffman Videos [about conditional statements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVq7Ms01RjA&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YqykuLs00261JCqnL_NNZ_&index=2)


## Feeling Functional?

If you want to continue learning, try following along with Daniel Shiffman's tutorials about functions. You may find them useful in organizing your non-linear narrative code (creating a function for each event).

   [Intro to Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCu7JSkgl04&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ajGB2OI3hl5DZsD1Fw1WzR&index=1)

- Functions are a means of taking the parts of our program and separating them
into modular pieces, making the code easier to read and understand and revise (making your future self happier)
- They can perform tasks or calculations (aka procedures or methods)
- Calling a function is same as writing line(), rect(), fill(). (these are
built-in functions) vs. user-defined functions
- modularity - functions break down larger programs into smaller parts - makes
code more manageable and readable
- reusability- allows us to code without having to retype everything
- 3 parts: return type(void, int, float, boolean), function name(whatever you want), arguments (parameters or values , passed into the function (variable declaration)
- written like:
returnType functionName(arguments){
 //code body of function
}

If this doesn't make sense, no worries, I will also go over it next week in class.
