## Project 1: Expanded Self
For homework last week, you read the short essays from Madeline Schwartzman's latest exhibition catalogue "See Yourself X". Think about the ideas she presents of extensions of the self. Consider how the computer is utilized as a tool to map and analyze the human body, face, activity, ect. Utilize any of the libraries (minim, sound, video, openCV) we have learned to use so far in class and make a project that extends the digital body beyond the possibilities of the physical body. Imagine a future. How might the body change, be used as interface, as marketing, as canvas -- try to think beyond the known.

You can checkout projectors from AV or the Grad Lab. Also, I know that the gradlab has mac minis with MadMapper on them. I will give you 30 minutes to setup at the beginning of class next week (come early if you need more time). We can also use the third floor classroom that we met in on the first day (320?) if need be.    

## Homework

- Finish "Expanded Self" project

## Resources

[Documentation of an ITP workshop on face recognition and face tracking taught by Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman/Face-It) - great processing examples and tutorials here

[Adam HArvey, CV Face detection Cascade visualized](https://vimeo.com/12774628),
"This video visualizes the detection process of OpenCV's face detector. The algorithm uses the Viola Jones method of calculating the integral image and then performing some calculations on all the areas defined by the black and white rectangles to analyze the differences between the dark and light regions of a face."
