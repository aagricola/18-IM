# Week 1: Introduction

## What is Interaction?
Presenting a participant with an opportunity to engage - frequently via a will to bring order to a given situation.

Interactivity identifies a mode of engagement between ourselves and machines (or others or objects)

Input-Processing-Output-Feedback

- Person-Person
- Person-Object
- Object-Object

Types:
- Minimal Interaction (like a tv remote)
- Interaction allows a choice for the narrative outcome
- Alters the physical form or the final outcome

The result of an interaction is a change of state or condition

## Poetic Computation
*"The main challenge is trying to create work that touches people at an emotional level, as opposed to them thinking about the technology or wondering how it was made. Making poems, not demos, is how we refer to it, i.e. making work that is like a poem, short yet dense, re-tellable, rhythmic, meaningful as opposed to a demo that just feels like technology for technology's sake. "*    -Zach Lieberman

*"Code can be a source of inspiration and it can help create previously unimaginable forms."*   - Casey Reas & Chandler Mcwilliams

[LifeForms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROmTHBg8Nw0) is a software used by Merce Cunningham to choreograph previously unimaginable forms.

Coding allows for dreams to become reality

## Interdisciplinary Thinking

Aim high, expect to fail, "whatever happens, happens"

Wabi-sabi
*"In traditional Japanese aesthetics, Wabi-sabi (侘寂) is a world view centered on the acceptance of transience and imperfection.[2] The aesthetic is sometimes described as one of beauty that is "imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete" - Wikipedia*

*"Allow your hands to get you into trouble - the perils of code based art: too much planning/thinking" James Rouvelle*

### Why should I learn to code?

 - Learning to code allows you to build your very own tools instead of using someone else's
 - Gateway to realizing new forms
 - Learn to see systems in everyday life
 - Learn to code, less be coded:

### Why should I learn to code with Processing?
 - Processing is an intuitive and visually responsive language to learn to code in
 - Learning through immediate visual feedback! (text in —> visuals out)
 - Fully functional programming language —> built on Java
 - It’s FREE — Open Source (lots of online resources for learning)
 - Its simplicity is ideal for the beginners

 [The Art of Creative Coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBV14-3LT-g)

*“A computer is nothing more than a machine that is brilliant at following precise instructions, but knows nothing about the world at large. And this is where we begin our journey, our story, our new life as a programmer. We begin with learning how to talk to our friend, the computer.”* -Daniel Shiffman

*Yoko Ono, "Cloud Piece", 1963*

And we talk to the computer using coded instructions called an algorithm. It is nothing more than a detailed instruction. While the word algorithm is usually used in the realm of computers, you could call any precise explanation of how to do something an algorithm - a baking recipe, knitting instruction, driving directions, ect.

#### WARNING: Do not be afraid to fail; every mistake you can (and possibly will) make has already been made before. Fail Flamboyantly!
In this class, we are more concerned with Prototyping/Experimenting/Playing than "succeeding"

## Assignment 1: Partner Portrait

 Partner up with someone in class. Learn a little bit about each other by asking questions. Then sketch a portrait of the person incorporating some details of what you learned about them - hobbies, place of origin, favorite food, or whatever. Think in primitive shapes like the ones we learned in Processing. Then translate your drawing into code in Processing. It can be representational or spontaneous and abstract. Most importantly **HAVE FUN!**

## Homework

 - There are a few optional recommended readings in this weeks resource folder, one from the book *Form & Code* by Casey Reas and Chandler McWilliams and one from *Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers*
 - Required is the pdf on Creative Process Journals
 - Finish your Partner Portrait. We will look at them at the beginning of our next class.
