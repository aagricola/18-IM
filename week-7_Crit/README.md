## Homework

 - Please submit your Project documentation to canvas!

 - [Order Arduino kit](https://www.amazon.com/Elegoo-EL-KIT-004-Project-Starter-Tutorial/dp/B01DGD2GAO/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1519253487&sr=8-7&keywords=arduino+kit)

 - Start your CPJ as we discussed in the first class. This is where you will keep track of your progress towards a final project, from ideation and research, to prototypes, failures, and successes. In my experience, it works best as a blog (separate from your portfolio site).
The final project will be lead by your own personal interests and desires, utilizing new acquired skills and adding to them by self directed research.
